				<h3>Lawless Interactive Performance System</h3>
				<h2>Project Proposal</h2>
				<h3>Abstract</h3>
				<p>My project idea is to build upon my performance system I have been building. The system uses a variety of programs with the goal of mixing audio reactive and audio driven visuals in a live performance setting. So far, I use Resolume to
					mix the visuals, digital media, and processing code live. This gives me the ability to add audio reactive effects to regular motion graphics. This requires creating content in any fashion. This semester I would like to work on creating more
					content and integrating Isadora into the mix by exploring its possibilities. I might work with Trason and develop some content that we can mix live with audio reactive effects. </p>

				<h3>Introduction to the project/Background on the System</h3>

				<p>This system uses a variety of programs with the goal of mixing audio reactive and audio driven visuals in a live performance setting. So far, I use Resolume to mix the visuals, digital media, and processing code live. Resolume “is an
					instrument for VJs, AV performers and video artists. It puts all your media and effects right at your fingertips so you can quickly improvise your live visuals (Resolume).” This gives me the ability to add audio reactive effects to
					regular
					motion graphics. During the semester I had developed the same idea of a project in two different fashions.
					The first iteration I used Processing, which is a creative Integrated Development Environment for Java programmers. In this application I designed a program to analyze sound being played live or through an audio file. Then I would send
					out
					shapes and control them with the data from the sound file, or the sound would generate shapes itself. I was also able to connect certain parameters to my Midi controller. This was the basis of me becoming a VJ. For those who do not know,
					a
					VJ’s job is to present visuals that represent or portray an artist’s performance.
				</p>

				<h3>Detailed description of the proposed project</h3>
				<p>This semester I would like to focus on developing content for my system. While doing that I hope to find a creative path that I can use to create detailed visual content easily.
					I would like to develop content using Maya. For the content, it will consist of 3D rendered pieces that I can bring into resolume and mix seamlessly. In Maya, I plan to develop
					animations that can be mapped to music through resolume and other pathways. I would also like to create a rendered piece to a specific song, from which I can draw content to use
					for other projects and performances. Essentially, I want to create VJ Loops and one animation/VJ mix to a certain song. </p>

				<p>In terms on animation I would love to learn how to capture motion data from a live performer. It would be really fun if I could capture motion data from the
					real world and animate characters with the motion data and an auto rigger.</p>

							<p>SPRING 2019 FINAL</p>
							<p>This was my final presentation for MART 440 Interactive Performance Systems. This is a system I've been working on for awhile and this is a small iteration of using this system. Here I am using Resolume to mix visuals that are
								generated and react to the music in real time. I enjoy making my visuals be driven by the audio and this is something I have been experimenting with for awhile now. I did not use any content or assets from previous work on this
								system.</p>

							<p>SPRING 2019 First Iteration</p>
							<p>Everything is automated, I did nothing but hit play.</p>
							<p>This is the first iteration of my VJ project for Interactive Performance Media during the Spring of 2019 at the University of Montana. This project uses processing to automate shapes reaction(s) to the music. The original project had
								Midi control that I used to control objects live while being played. I also had a few more elements in there that I had to take out. This version is fully automated and driven by the audio. The original had almost identical audio
								reactions but some additional elements, background color, and videos. Once I get the chance I would like to record a preformed version on a better computer so the graphics can keep up.

							<p> ISSUES:
								I developed this on my laptop, but it did not have a good enough graphics to run it so I went on campus and used a lab computer there. This computer: i7 processor, 32gb, and a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770. This still was not enough to keep
								Processing at the current frame rate, you can see when the bass comes in that the sketch gets slowed down a lot. This issue is the main problem that keeps me from developing dynamic coded visuals in a timely manner.</p>

				<h3>Related Work and Background</h3>
				<section>
					<div class="content">
						<div class="row">
							<h3>Where it all started</h3>
							<p>It all started with me playing around in After Effects and using the Trapcode Suite plug in from Red Giant.
								In the suite they have a lot of audio reaction tools to use with their systems. This is where I started and fell in love with
								making audio reactive and audio driven art. It pushed me to experiment with different designs and concepts and eventually pushing me into a
								new realm developing audio reactive visuals.</p>
							<br>
							<p>The reason this is important to my system is due to my fascination with creating audio reactive art. In an ideal system I would be able to create pieces like this but live and in real time. All of this work shown in this section has
								been designed, created, and rendered out to a specific song. And that's when it dawned on me. What if I could create visuals like this but have them react in real time to music that is being played live? The spawn of this system
								stemmed from the creation of these rendered pieces.</p>

				<h3>Project Significance</h3>
				<p>After graduation I would love to become a VJ for a musician or work on a creative team that develops interactive systems, installations, and stage setups. I still believe I need to develop some more coding skills in other languages. I also
					wish to work on my animation and 3d animation.</p>

				<p>This system will hopefully show that I have the resources and know how to work in such an environment that I would encounter either VJing or working for a creative team.</p>
				<p>system creation, interaction, creative coding, programming</p>
				<br>

				<h3>Potential Challenges and Problems</h3>
				<p>The biggest threat that poses against me is having adequate hardware to run my system and develop 3D animations.
					I'm currently trying to save up and buy compenents to build my own computer at my cost. If I am able to build this
					computer by the end of this semester I will be set and ready for any future performances.</p>
				<br>

				<h3>Work-plan and Deliverables</h3>
				<p>Work with Stephanie on creating content in Maya and creating a work plan for animating/capturing data.</p>
