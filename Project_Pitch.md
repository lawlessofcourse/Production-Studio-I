Good afternoon MART Productions Studio Students!

As a reminder, I want you to be prepared to talk about and present your project ideas tomorrow. To help you with that, I want you to answer these three questions.

1. What is your project idea? Please write an elevator-style pitch for your project idea. Something succinct, that gets to the meat of what you want to accomplish.

2. What are your goals beyond graduation? And/or, what skills do you believe you need to develop before you graduate?

3. How does your project help you with the goals stated in question number 2?

My project idea is to build upon my performance system I have been building. The system uses a variety of programs with the goal of mixing audio reactive and audio driven visuals in a live performance setting. So far, I use Resolume to mix the visuals, digital media, and processing code live. This gives me the ability to add audio reactive effects to regular motion graphics. This requires creating content in any fashion. This semester I would like to work on creating more content and integrating Isadora into the mix by exploring its possibilities. I might work with Trason and develop some content that we can mix live with audio reactive effects. 

After graduation I would love to become a VJ for a musician or work on a creative team that develops interactive systems, installations, and stage setups. I still believe I need to develop some more coding skills in other languages. I also wish to work on my animation and 3d animation.

 This system will hopefully show that I have the resources and know how to work in such an environment that I would encounter either VJing or working for a creative team.
